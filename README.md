## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Mazione, and I'm working towards becoming a full-stack developer.

### ðŸ”­ What I'm working on:
- Currently, I'm organizing my GitHub profile. All the projects I created during my learning journey are private for now.
- As I review some of my project, Iâ€™ll gradually make them public, incorporating new skills and improvements I've learned along the way.
- My primary projects will be showcased on the main page (Repositories), featuring my own work. One key project is already there under the backend pathway but is still private for now.

### ðŸŒ± What I'm learning:
- **React** (in TypeScript) and **Nest.js** are my current focus areas.
- I'm also exploring new tools and technologies, such as **OpenAI API** for future projects.

### ðŸ“‚ Profile Structure:
- **Main Repositories**: This is where my key projects will be displayed.
- **Organizations**: 
  - **MyFrontEndPathways**: This includes technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, **SCSS**, **Bootstrap**, and some **JavaScript**.
  - **BackendPathways**: A focus on backend development using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MySQL**, **MongoDB**, **TypeScript**, and my initial journey with **JavaScript**.
  - **ReactPathways**: As the name suggests, this is where you can find my **React** projects, all developed in **TypeScript**. I currently have two small projects that are public and ready to explore.

### ðŸ’¬ Feel free to reach out if:
- You want to collaborate on interesting full-stack projects.
- You have any questions about the technologies I'm learning or working with.

### âš¡ Fun fact:
- I'm constantly looking for ways to improve my coding skills and love experimenting with new frameworks and libraries!
