## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Mazione, and I'm working towards becoming a full-stack developer.

### ðŸ”­ What I'm working on:
I'm currently focusing on building my main fullstack project:
Automotive Task Management App â€” a system for tracking job cards, tasks, and work sessions, built with React, Express, and MySQL, secured via VPN for remote access.
This is my key project right now, and I'm planning to deploy it in October 2025.

Alongside that, I'm organizing my GitHub profile. All the projects I created during my learning journey are private for now.
As I review some of my work, Iâ€™ll gradually make them public, incorporating new skills and improvements I've learned along the way.
My primary projects will be showcased on the main page (Repositories), featuring my own work. One key project is already there under the backend pathway but is still private for now.

### ðŸŒ± What I'm learning:
Although you wonâ€™t see many repositories under React yet, Iâ€™ve been learning React with TypeScript for over a year now and Iâ€™m actively using it in my own projects â€” including my current key project: the Automotive Task Management App. I feel confident building fullstack apps with React and Express.

After completing that project, I plan to launch a new system: the Time Tracking System, built with Nest.js.
This application will include live communication (chat) and more advanced architecture using modular structure, dependency injection, and WebSocket support â€” things Nest.js handles better than Express for scalable, real-time systems.
Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m transitioning to Nest.js for this use case, to match the systemâ€™s complexity and future growth.

I'm also exploring tools like the OpenAI API to enhance future projects with AI-based capabilities.
### ðŸ“‚ Profile Structure:
- **Main Repositories**: This is where my key projects will be displayed.
- **Organizations**: 
  - **MyFrontEndPathways**: This includes technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, **SCSS**, **Bootstrap**, and some **JavaScript**.
  - **BackendPathways**: A focus on backend development using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MySQL**, **MongoDB**, **TypeScript**, and my initial journey with **JavaScript**.
  - **ReactPathways**: As the name suggests, this is where you can find my **React** projects, all developed in **TypeScript**. I currently have two small projects that are public and ready to explore.

### ðŸ’¬ Feel free to reach out if:
- You want to collaborate on interesting full-stack projects.
- You have any questions about the technologies I'm learning or working with.

### âš¡ Fun fact:
- I'm constantly looking for ways to improve my coding skills and love experimenting with new frameworks and libraries!
